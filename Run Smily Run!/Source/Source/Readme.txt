Created by Klas af Geijerstam.
The game is based on my engine, created with XNA/MonoGame: SimpleTileEngine wich you can get a copy of by sending me an email.

Game, sourcecode and mapeditor is totally free and feel free to use my code in your own projects.
The game is very simple and the default map is very basic, but you may create your own maps with the editor.
If you use any of my code or textures please send me an email telling me about it and if you find any bugs please report
them to the same email.

Hope my game is playable. / Klas.
